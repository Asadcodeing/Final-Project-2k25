## 📘 Abstract
We enhance YOLO-based road object detection by replacing CSPDarknet53 with **EfficientNet**, improving speed and accuracy with fewer parameters. Our **Dynamic Feature Prioritization Module (DFPM)** allocates resources to critical objects, while the **Temporal Contextual Optimization (TCO)** module enhances tracking and occlusion handling. Designed for edge devices, our model ensures **real-time detection** with high efficiency and minimal computational cost.  
**Experimental results** show significant improvements in detection accuracy and inference speed, making it ideal for real-world applications like autonomous vehicles.
